# Marek Marusic

Seasoned Software Engineer with 9+ years of experience. Passionate about solving complex problems alongside talented teams. Continuously seeking to expand my skills and improve myself with a growth mindset. My first contact with code was in 2008 (was 15 years old) when I started to read books about PHP, SQL and Linux. Later on I started to host and write web pages for web eshops and write automation scripts with PHP. Later on I was playing with multiple linux distros and ended up using Arch Linux as my daily driver during the first years of university studies. After all these endevours I was able to join Red Hat and jump start my SWE carrer alongside my fulltime university studies.
